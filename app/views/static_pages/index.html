                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a Quality Assurance Engineer with over 12 years of software testing and team leadership experience. My QA expertise includes writing detailed test plans, test cases, analyzing test results, creating detailed defect reports, performing manual, automated, accessibility, security, and performance testing of high-profile and high-traffic web sites, mobile sites, as well as native iOS, Android, and Xbox apps. I have strong management skills in identifying project risk, creating mitigation strategies, developing effective QA processes and timelines across multiple offices as well as delegating project work, and resource management. I am able to manage multiple projects simultaneously while working with stakeholders across departments to deliver timely and high quality products to clients. I pride myself in being creative and innovative in my work and see the user experience as both the guide for developing effective processes and products and the bottom-line of a QA team’s measure of success.

In my recent work as a Principal QA Engineer with a leading digital agency I have leveraged and refined my leadership skills by managing teams that ensured the quality of sites viewed by millions of people per day for companies such as Pepsi, ExxonMobil, NBC Universal, Jet Blue, Target, Maybelline, Comcast, American Express and many more.
